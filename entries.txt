    I've decided to get back into learning how to code and have been following The Odin Project's guide to 
    learning web development. The content has been very good so far. I'm currently working on the section
    with freecodecamp.com's Responsive Web Design Certification. I now have a basic understanding of
    HTML and some CSS. I will take my skills further and learn more each day.

    Just finished the CSS grid section and all the other introductory courses on FCC.
    I'm now beginning the projects section. I still need to commit some of the material
    to memory but I think I'm ready to build my first website. Of course, I'll still
    be googling some concepts that I'll have trouble recalling, but even the most
    experienced developers still use Google so I'm not worried about that.

    Began the first project on the Responsive Web Development section in FCC. I'm making a tribute page
    dedicated to Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web. I'm using an online app called
    CodePen; the interface is visually pleasing and it's easy to use. The HTML is coming along nicely
    and I'm looking forward to making the website come to life with the CSS.

    I've completed the tribute page dedicated to Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web.
    That project has helped me understand CSS grid a little bit better and I'm now implementing grid 
    on the second FCC project on building a survey page. It is coming along nicely, although, the CSS 
    portion looks a bit more advanced on the example given. I'll try to emulate the example on my own 
    page and add my own personal touches.

	It's been a while since I last practiced using git. Update on my progress: I discontinued the web development 
    route and decided to go data science. I'm currently doing Dataquest's data science course and I have my eyes on 
    building a scaled down Mars rover.
