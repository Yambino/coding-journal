    I've decided to get back into learning how to code and have been following The Odin Project's guide to 
    learning web development. The content has been very good so far. I'm currently working on the section
    with freecodecamp.com's Responsive Web Design Certification. I now have a basic understanding of
    HTML and some CSS. I will take my skills further and learn more each day.
